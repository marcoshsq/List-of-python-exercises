### If... else

The if statement is one of the most basic control structures, it basically follows this flowchart:

</div>


The logic is pretty simple, you want Python to do something only if a condition is met, otherwise it will do something else, e.g.: Let's say you are a seller of alcoholic beverages, and you need to create a system for your online store, in your system you cannot sell alcohol to minors. Therefore, your system needs to ask customers for their age. And decide whether they can buy it or not.

```python
age = int(input('Enter your age: '))        # Frist we ask for the client's age;
if age < 18:                                # Then we tell Python, if the client has less than 18 years;
    print('I\'m sorry, you\'re underage!')  # print this;
else:                                       # else means else u.u
    print('Welcome, have fun!')             # print this u.u
```

### If...elif...elif... else

We can also check more than one if condition before we get to the else statement. For this we use the else if statement, elif statement.

<div align="center">

Let's say that in your online liquor store you received a notification that seniors can no longer buy alcoholic beverages, because of public health reasons u.u. Now you cannot sell to over 70s. Let's update our system.

```python
age = int(input('Enter your age: '))
if age < 18:
    print('I\'m sorry, you\'re underage!')
elif age > 70:                                
    print('Sorry, For legal reasons, we cannot sell to you')
else:
    print('Welcome, have fun!')
```

## Atention:

We are programming in a sequential way, that is, imagine that each line of your program is like a list:

1. start here
2. then do this
3. then this
4. then this
5. then this
6. then this
7. end here

Python will follow thi list when running your code, what I'm trying to say is, Build your code logically so that every line of code is accessed if needed. For example, Let's say you've started selling soft drinks to people under 15, it's a SpongeBob store, and you decide to use your store's system to recommend this to people under 15, let's update our code.

```python

age = int(input('Enter your age: '))
if age < 18:
    print('I\'m sorry, you\'re underage!')
elif age > 70:
    print('Sorry, For legal reasons, we cannot sell to you')
elif age <= 15:
    print('We have this spongebob store, look how cool. spongebobshop.com ')
else:
    print('Welcome, have fun!')

```
If you run this code, and enter a value lower than 15, you will notice a problem. The spongebob recommendation does not appear, why? Like I said, we are programming in a sequential way, which means that, Python will first ask the age, if we enter, anything between 18 and 70, it will say "Wellcome, have fun", if we print anything above 70, it will say "Sorry, For legal reasons, we cannot sell to you", now, if we put anything under 18, it will first go to our first line, that say, if age is less than 18, give to the user "I'm sorry, you\'re underage!", and finish the program, the problem is 15 is less than 18, but python will never get to that line. And the kids will never know about your Sponge Bob Shop, that's why is super important that you write your code in a sequential and logical way, so we don't let the kids down, ok? Let's fix our code.

```python

age = int(input('Enter your age: '))
if age <= 15:
    print('We have this spongebob store, look how cool. spongebobshop.com ')
elif age < 18:
    print('I\'m sorry, you\'re underage!')
elif age > 70:
    print('Sorry, For legal reasons, we cannot sell to you')
else:
    print('Welcome, have fun!')

```

### Indentation

Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

##

### Elif

The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

````python
a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
  
````
##

### Else

The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

````python
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")
````

Now that we've reviewed the entire contents of the ifs statement, I need you to pay close attention, because nested if's are super hard to understand, so wacht carefully.

##

### If Inside If

You can have if statements inside if statements, this is called nested if statements. Here's an example:

````python
x = 41
if x > 10:
  print("Above ten,")
  if x > 20:
    print("and also above 20!")
  else:
    print("but not above 20.")


##


That's it, simple isn't? Some important notes:

- Identation, blocks of code are defined by indentation. Code on the same indent level are in the same block. Python will not allow mixed indentation, it's very important that you respect that, ok! 
- For indentation we use 4 spaces, if you are going to use tab, you must configure your IDE, or interpreter to make the tab in space. The important thing is not to mix spaces and tabs. Python is very sensitive about this.
- And lastly the colon, colon is used to represent an indented block. Every time you do something in python that needs indented blocks (for loops, while loops, def functions, etc.), you need the colon ('':'').

### Lesson Wrap Up:

````python

name = input('Enter your name')
if name == 'Alice':
    print('Hi, Alice.')
elif name == 'Joe':
    print('Hi, Alice.')
else:
    print('Hello, stranger.')
````

### Conclusion:

In this lesson we will talk about if, elif and else, in the next one we will talk about nested if, it's like that movie inception by Nolan where Leonardo di Carpio enters a dream within a dream, only different from the movie, it's important to understand what are nested if.
