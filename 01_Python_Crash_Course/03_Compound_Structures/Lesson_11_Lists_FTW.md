### Why do I need a List if I have a Tuple?

Because lists are mutable u.u

Actually, there are a few more differences between lists and tuples, but basically, almost all of them occur because of this mutability rule. I'll give you a few examples:

| LIST |	TUPLE |
| :-- | :-- |
| Lists are mutable |	Tuples are immutable |
| Implication of iterations is Time-consuming |	The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster |
| The list is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion. |	Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements |
| Lists consume more memory |	Tuple consume less memory as compared to the list |
| Lists have several built-in methods |	Tuple does not have many built-in methods. |
| The unexpected changes and errors are more likely to occur |	In tuple, it is hard to take place. |
